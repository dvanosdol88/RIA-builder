ALWAYS follow these architecture principles on ALL projects:

1. **Configuration-Driven Design** - Define categories, labels, navigation, and options in config files, never hardcoded throughout the app

2. **Single Source of Truth** - Any value used in multiple places must be defined once and referenced everywhere

3. **Loosely Coupled Components** - Components must be generic and reusable, receiving data as props

4. **Modular Architecture** - Features must be independent modules that can be added/removed without breaking others

5. **Data-Driven UI** - UI renders dynamically from config/data, not hardcoded structures

## Safety Rules (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- RULE #1: Do NOT break the app
- RULE #2: See Rule #1
- Before major refactors, explain the risk and wait for approval
- Preserve existing functionality when adding features

## Communication
- Explain what you plan to do before doing it
- After completing a task, summarize what was changed
- Flag any concerns or potential issues proactively

## Project Context
Always read project-level instruction files if they exist:
- CLAUDE.md
- .cursorrules
- AGENTS.md
- gemini.md
- README.md (AI Instructions section)---
